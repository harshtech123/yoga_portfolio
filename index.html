      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Shruti Gaikwad, a passionate and dedicated yoga teacher with
        a journey that has transformed not only my own life but the lives of
        many others. My yoga journey began several years ago when I first
        discovered the profound impact that mindful movement and breathwork
        could have on my physical and mental well-being. What started as a
        personal exploration quickly grew into a deep passion for sharing this
        ancient practice with others. Over the years, I have immersed myself in
        various styles of yoga, learning from some of the most respected
        teachers in the field. My approach to yoga is holistic, combining
        traditional techniques with modern insights to create a practice that is
        accessible, enriching, and deeply transformative. As a yoga influencer,
        I strive to inspire others by sharing not just the physical aspects of
        yoga but also the mental and spiritual benefits that come with a
        consistent practice. My classes and content are designed to empower
        individuals, helping them to build strength, find balance, and cultivate
        a sense of inner peace, regardless of where they are on their yoga
        journey.

          <h3>Hatha Yoga</h3>
          <p>
            Hatha Yoga is one of the most traditional forms of yoga, focusing on
            physical postures (asanas) and breathing techniques (pranayama).
            It's a gentle practice that emphasizes alignment and slow,
            deliberate movements. Hatha Yoga is great for beginners and those
            looking to improve their overall balance and flexibility.

          <h3>Ashtanga Yoga</h3>
          <p>
            Ashtanga Yoga is a rigorous style of yoga that follows a specific
            sequence of postures, performed in a fast-paced and physically
            demanding manner. It's designed to build strength, flexibility, and
            stamina. Ashtanga is suitable for those who are looking for a
            challenging and disciplined practice.

          <h3>Vinyasa Yoga</h3>
          <p>
            Vinyasa Yoga is characterized by a dynamic flow of postures, where
            each movement is synchronized with breath. Often referred to as
            "flow" yoga, it is more fast-paced and energetic compared to Hatha
            Yoga. Vinyasa classes vary in intensity and can range from gentle to
            vigorous.

          <h3>Kundalini Yoga</h3>
          <p>
            Kundalini Yoga combines physical postures, breathwork, chanting, and
            meditation to awaken the energy at the base of the spine and bring
            it upward through the chakras. It's a spiritual practice that aims
            to increase awareness and consciousness.
